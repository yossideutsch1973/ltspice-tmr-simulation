# TMR Sensor Array - Handoff Document

## Current Status (Mar 8, 2023)

All schematic diagrams have been reviewed and the following issues have been fixed:

1. **Level Shifter Circuit (stage3_level_shifter.png)**:
   - Fixed the disconnected non-inverting input (+) pin of the op-amp by adding a visible junction dot
   - Fixed the disconnected inverting input (-) pin by adding a connection from R12 to the op-amp and a visible junction dot
   - Fixed the disconnected output pin by adding a proper connection to both the feedback network and the output EMI filter
   - Completed the implementation of the level shifter circuit which was previously incomplete

2. **Active Low-Pass Filter (stage2_active_lowpass_filter.png)**:
   - Fixed variable naming issues to ensure proper connections are shown
   - Resolved output point definition to eliminate 'NameError' exceptions

3. **Drawing Function Returns**:
   - Updated all drawing functions to properly return their Drawing objects
   - Fixed several bugs in the main function to correctly handle the returned Drawing objects

4. **LTSpice Integration**:
   - Updated the export_to_ltspice function call to match the function signature
   - Properly implemented the model specifications for component models

## Verification Completed

A thorough pin connection check was performed on all circuits, verifying that:

1. All op-amp pins are properly connected according to their LTSpice model definitions:
   - OPA2387 in the level shifter and active filter circuits
   - AD8220 in the instrumentation amplifier circuit
   
2. All power connections have proper decoupling capacitors
   
3. All signal paths are complete with no floating pins or unintended open circuits

## Next Steps for Future Work

1. **Multiplexer Circuit Enhancement**:
   - The multiplexer circuit could benefit from more detailed control logic implementation
   - Consider adding detailed address decoding logic for clarity

2. **ADC Interface Refinement**:
   - The ADC interface could use more detailed SPI connection implementation
   - Consider adding digital isolator circuits for the SPI bus

3. **Documentation Improvements**:
   - Add more detailed technical notes to each schematic
   - Consider adding a comprehensive signal chain description document

4. **Circuit Optimization**:
   - Perform component value optimization based on LTSpice simulation results
   - Consider adding temperature compensation circuits for critical components

5. **Additional Testing**:
   - Implement more comprehensive LTSpice test scenarios
   - Add Monte Carlo analysis for component tolerance effects

## Known Issues

There are no known issues with the current implementation. All schematics are correctly generating and all components have proper connections.

## Running the Code

To generate all schematics:
```bash
./run_script.sh tmr_schematic_drawer.py
```

The script handles the Python environment issues that were previously occurring with the 'encodings' module.

## Files of Interest

- `tmr_schematic_drawer.py` - Main script that generates all schematics
- `schematics/` - Directory containing all generated schematic images
- `ltspice_models/` - Directory containing LTSpice model files
- `ltspice_integration.py` - Module for LTSpice integration

## LTSpice Models

The LTSpice models are defined in `ltspice_models/tmr_models.lib` and include:
- AD8220 Instrumentation Amplifier
- OPA2387 Precision Op-Amp
- TMR2305 Tunneling Magnetoresistive Sensor
- ADG1607 16-channel Multiplexer
- ADS8688 16-bit ADC

These models are used for simulation and match the component connections in the schematic diagrams.
