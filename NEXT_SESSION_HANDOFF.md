# TMR Schematic Implementation - Next Session Handoff

## Current Status

We've enhanced the TMR sensor array schematics based on engineering review feedback and fixed various issues with the code. The improvements are implemented in the `tmr_schematic_drawer.py` script, which uses the SchemaDraw library to create professional circuit diagrams. 

The latest updates include:

1. **Added LTSpice Integration**:
   - Created a comprehensive `ltspice_integration.py` module for exporting schematics to LTSpice
   - Added functionality to generate netlist files for all circuit diagrams
   - Implemented component model library generation for simulation
   - Added simulation parameter configuration for various analysis types
   - Created temperature sweep capabilities for thermal analysis
   - Added the module to the main script with proper error handling

2. **Improved Documentation**:
   - Created a comprehensive `USER_GUIDE.md` with detailed information on using the tool
   - Updated the README.md with information about the LTSpice integration
   - Added command-line options documentation
   - Enhanced the overall structure of documentation
   - Added future enhancements section to outline planned improvements

3. **Completed Multiplexer and ADC Refactoring**:
   - Fully implemented the multiplexer and ADC drawing functions with proper code structure
   - Fixed all duplicated direction parameter warnings in these functions
   - Used consistent positioning with `.at()` and `.to()` methods instead of directional methods
   - Added detailed comments and improved code organization

4. **Fixed Duplicated Direction Parameter Warnings**:
   - Resolved all warnings about duplicated direction parameters in SchemaDraw
   - Replaced instances of using both `.at()` and directional methods (`.down()`, `.right()`, etc.) with proper alternatives
   - Used `.at()` and `.to()` methods for positioning instead of directional methods when absolute positioning was needed
   - Fixed variable definition issues (e.g., r8_pos in the active filter function, spacing in the ADC function)

5. **Comprehensive Code Refactoring**:
   - Extracted common circuit components into reusable functions
   - Improved error handling with proper logging and traceback
   - Reduced code duplication throughout the codebase
   - Applied functional programming principles for more maintainable code
   - Added type hints and improved documentation

6. **Previous Engineering Improvements**:
   - Added proper component tolerances
   - Fixed open pins on IC components
   - Added decoupling capacitors throughout the design
   - Implemented input protection circuits
   - Added proper power connections and references
   - Added test points and design annotations
   - Included detailed technical notes for each circuit stage

A comprehensive summary of all engineering improvements can be found in `schematic_improvements.md`.
Documentation of the refactoring changes can be found in the `REFACTORING.md` file.
The full list of recent changes can be found in the `CHANGES_MADE.md` file.

## Previous Issues (RESOLVED)

1. **Environment Issues**: The Python environment problem has been resolved through the `run_script.sh` script that properly configures the environment.

2. **SchemaDraw Compatibility**: The code has been updated to be compatible with SchemaDraw 0.19, including fixing the opamp anchor naming issues.

3. **Duplicated Direction Parameter Warnings**: All instances of these warnings have been fixed by replacing code using both `.at()` and directional methods with proper alternatives.

4. **Multiplexer and ADC Refactoring**: Both the multiplexer and ADC drawing functions have been fully implemented and refactored to use consistent positioning methods.

5. **LTSpice Integration**: Added LTSpice export functionality with a dedicated module and comprehensive documentation.

6. **Documentation**: Created a comprehensive user guide and updated all project documentation.

All schematics now generate correctly without warnings and are saved to the `schematics` directory.
LTSpice model files are generated and saved to the `ltspice_models` directory.

## Next Steps for the Next Session

1. **Configuration Management**:
   - Move circuit values to configuration objects for easier maintenance
   - Implement a more flexible configuration system for component values
   - Make circuit parameters more easily adjustable without code changes

2. **Remaining Engineering Improvements** (from `schematic_improvements.md`):
   - Temperature compensation circuits
   - Self-test capabilities
   - Advanced filtering techniques
   - Differential signaling for critical paths
   - Power sequencing circuits

3. **Enhanced LTSpice Integration**:
   - Implement direct ASC file generation for schematic viewing in LTSpice
   - Add more detailed component models with accurate parameters
   - Create pre-configured simulation setups for different analysis types
   - Add Monte Carlo analysis for component tolerance simulation

4. **GitHub Repository**:
   - Set up automated testing using GitHub Actions
   - Implement version tagging for releases
   - Add contribution guidelines and templates

## Useful Commands

- Run the main schematic drawer:
  ```bash
  ./run_script.sh tmr_schematic_drawer.py
  ```

- Run with specific options:
  ```bash
  ./run_script.sh tmr_schematic_drawer.py --unit-size 3.0 --format png svg
  ```

- Run individual test scripts:
  ```bash
  ./run_script.sh simple_test.py
  ./run_script.sh tmr_stage1.py
  ```

- Check SchemaDraw version:
  ```bash
  ./run_script.sh -c "import schemdraw; print(schemdraw.__version__)"
  ```

The project is now in an excellent state with all warnings and errors resolved, and all circuit diagrams fully implemented. The code is significantly improved in terms of both functionality and style. The next session can focus on implementing the configuration management system and adding the remaining engineering improvements. Additionally, the LTSpice integration can be further enhanced with more detailed component models and simulation setups.
