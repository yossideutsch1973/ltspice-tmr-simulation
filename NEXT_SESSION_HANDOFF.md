# TMR Schematic Implementation - Next Session Handoff

## Current Status

We've enhanced the TMR sensor array schematics based on engineering review feedback. The improvements are implemented in the `tmr_schematic_drawer.py` script, which uses the SchemaDraw library to create professional circuit diagrams. The improvements include:

- Added proper component tolerances
- Fixed open pins on IC components
- Added decoupling capacitors throughout the design
- Implemented input protection circuits
- Added proper power connections and references
- Added test points and design annotations
- Included detailed technical notes for each circuit stage

A comprehensive summary of all improvements can be found in `schematic_improvements.md`.

## Current Issue

We encountered an issue with the Python environment when trying to run the schematic drawing script. The error indicates a problem with the Python encoding module and possibly with the virtual environment configuration:

```
Fatal Python error: init_fs_encoding: failed to get the Python codec of the filesystem encoding
Python runtime state: core initialized
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'encodings'
```

## Next Steps for the Next Session

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Create and activate a new Python virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv schematic_venv
     source schematic_venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: schematic_venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - Install required dependencies in the new environment:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Research and Fix SchemaDraw Issues**:
   - Search for documentation on SchemaDraw 0.19 API:
     - Official documentation: https://schemdraw.readthedocs.io/
     - GitHub repository: https://github.com/mph-/schemdraw
     - PyPI page: https://pypi.org/project/schemdraw/

   - Common areas to check:
     - Element creation and positioning API
     - Anchor point handling
     - Label positioning
     - Element parameters and attributes

3. **Verify Implementation**:
   - Run simple tests to verify SchemaDraw functionality:
     ```bash
     python simple_test.py
     ```

   - Test individual stages to verify each component:
     ```bash
     python tmr_stage1.py
     ```

   - Run the full script once issues are resolved:
     ```bash
     python tmr_schematic_drawer.py
     ```

4. **Further Improvements**:
   - Consider additional enhancements listed in the "Future Improvements" section of `schematic_improvements.md`
   - Validate the schematics against the original ASCII diagrams
   - Add more advanced circuit protection if needed

## Resources Already Created

- `tmr_schematic_drawer.py` - Main script implementing all circuit diagrams
- `requirements.txt` - Package dependencies for the project
- `schematic_improvements.md` - Summary of all enhancements made
- `simple_test.py`, `opamp_test.py`, `opamp_anchors.py` - Test scripts for SchemaDraw functionality
- `tmr_stage1.py` - Implementation of Stage 1 (Instrumentation Amplifier) for testing
- `schematics/` - Directory for output diagram files

## Useful Commands for Debugging

- Check SchemaDraw version:
  ```bash
  python -c "import schemdraw; print(schemdraw.__version__)"
  ```

- List available modules in SchemaDraw:
  ```bash
  python -c "import schemdraw; print(dir(schemdraw))"
  ```

- Check SchemaDraw elements:
  ```bash
  python -c "import schemdraw.elements as elm; print(dir(elm))"
  ```

- Check environment information:
  ```bash
  python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable); print(sys.path)"
  ```
