## Current Task: TMR Sensor Array Schematic Implementation

Continue the work on implementing the TMR sensor array analog front-end circuit schematics using Python and the SchemaDraw library. The previous session enhanced the schematics based on engineering review but encountered a Python environment issue.

### Priority Tasks

1. **Fix Python Environment Issues**:
   - Research the root cause of the "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'encodings'" error
   - Create a clean, properly configured Python environment
   - Test environment configuration thoroughly before proceeding
   - Document the solution process for future reference

2. **Research SchemaDraw 0.19 API**:
   - Scrape and analyze the latest SchemaDraw documentation
   - Study examples from GitHub repositories and forums
   - Create simple test cases to verify API understanding
   - Update our implementation to match the current API requirements

3. **Complete and Test Schematic Implementation**:
   - Review and optimize each circuit implementation
   - Ensure all improvements from engineering review are correctly implemented
   - Validate generated schematics against original ASCII diagrams
   - Optimize code structure using functional programming principles where applicable

4. **Documentation and Repository Updates**:
   - Update all documentation to reflect changes and process
   - Maintain git repository with clear commit messages
   - Create detailed readme and usage instructions
   - Prepare handoff for future sessions if needed

### Approach Guidelines

1. **Iterative Development and Testing**:
   - Test continually throughout development
   - Start with simplest working examples and build up
   - Don't assume any part works until verified

2. **Research Process**:
   - Start with official documentation
   - Examine GitHub repository issues and examples
   - Check Stack Overflow and engineering forums
   - If needed, scrape example code from similar projects

3. **Code Quality Standards**:
   - Apply functional programming principles (pure functions, immutability, etc.)
   - Use descriptive variable and function names
   - Include meaningful comments
   - Organize code in logical modules
   - Add appropriate error handling

4. **Validation Process**:
   - Verify output visually against original ASCII diagrams
   - Ensure all engineering improvements are properly implemented
   - Check that all component connections are electrically correct
   - Validate component values and specifications

## Specific Technical Focus Areas

1. **SchemaDraw Element API Changes**: Focus on how element creation, anchoring, and positioning has evolved in version 0.19

2. **Python Environment Configuration**: Understand the requirements for a properly functioning Python environment with the necessary libraries

3. **Circuit Validation**: Ensure all schematics follow electrical engineering best practices and accurately represent the intended circuits

4. **Code Architecture**: Refactor the implementation using functional programming principles where possible for better maintainability and reliability

Complete each task thoroughly before moving to the next, always documenting your process and updating project files as you progress. When the implementation is complete and verified, update all documentation and commit the changes to the git repository with clear, descriptive commit messages.
