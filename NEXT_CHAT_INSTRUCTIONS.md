## Project Status

This project implements circuit schematics for a TMR Sensor Array analog front-end using Python and the SchemaDraw library. We've recently completed several important fixes:

1. Fixed connection issues in the level shifter circuit:
   - Non-inverting input (+) pin connection
   - Inverting input (-) pin connection 
   - Op-amp output pin connection

2. Fixed variable definition issues in the active filter circuit

3. Improved code structure with proper function return values

4. Updated all documentation files with current status and changes

All schematics now generate correctly, and all component pins are properly connected according to their respective LTSpice model definitions.

## Suggested Next Steps

1. **Multiplexer and ADC Enhancement**:
   - The multiplexer and ADC circuits could benefit from more detailed implementations
   - Consider adding detailed control logic and SPI interface connections

2. **Advanced Simulation**:
   - Develop more comprehensive LTSpice simulations
   - Implement Monte Carlo analysis for component tolerance effects

3. **Documentation Improvements**:
   - Create more detailed circuit explanation documents
   - Add more comprehensive technical notes to schematics

## Key Files

- `tmr_schematic_drawer.py` - Main script that generates all schematics
- `ltspice_integration.py` - Module for LTSpice integration
- `NEXT_SESSION_HANDOFF.md` - Detailed status report and future work suggestions
- `CHANGES_MADE.md` - List of recent changes with code examples
- `schematics/` - Directory containing all generated schematic images
- `ltspice_models/` - Directory containing LTSpice model files

## How to Run the Code

To generate all schematics:
```bash
./run_script.sh tmr_schematic_drawer.py
```

This script handles the Python environment issues and outputs PNG files to the schematics directory.

## Additional Notes

- We've completed a thorough pin connection check for all circuits
- All op-amps (OPA2387, AD8220) have correct connections to their inputs, outputs, and power pins
- The level shifter is now correctly implemented with proper feedback and reference circuitry
- The active filter has been fixed with correct variable definitions

If you have questions about any of the implementations or find additional issues that need fixing, please refer to the detailed documentation in `CHANGES_MADE.md` and `NEXT_SESSION_HANDOFF.md`.
