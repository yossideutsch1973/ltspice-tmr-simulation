# TMR Schematic Drawer Refactoring

This document outlines the refactoring changes made to the `tmr_schematic_drawer.py` script to improve maintainability, reduce code duplication, and enhance error handling.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Code Organization

- **Logical Sections**: Organized code into logical sections with clear separators for better readability
- **Type Aliases**: Added type aliases for common types (`Point`, `PinMap`, etc.)
- **Improved Documentation**: Enhanced docstrings and comments throughout the code

### 2. Extracted Common Components

Created reusable functions for common circuit elements:

- `add_title_and_notes()`: Standardized title and notes formatting
- `add_power_supply()`: Common power supply connection function
- `add_decoupling_capacitors()`: Decoupling capacitor patterns
- `add_input_protection()`: Standard input protection circuit
- `add_test_point()`: Standardized test point creation
- `add_technical_notes()`: Formatting for technical notes sections
- `add_opamp_power()`: Common op-amp power connections

### 3. Improved Error Handling

- Added `log_errors()` function to track function call arguments
- Implemented `with_error_handling` decorator for consistent error handling
- Added detailed error messages with traceback
- Graceful continuation when a circuit drawing fails (doesn't stop the entire program)
- Enhanced error reporting in the `save_drawing()` function

### 4. Applied Functional Programming Principles

- Used function composition for complex operations
- Reduced state mutations where possible
- Made functions more modular and reusable
- Returned and passed drawing objects rather than relying on side effects
- Used higher-order functions like decorators

### 5. Code Duplication Reduction

- Consolidated repeated patterns into utility functions
- Replaced multiple similar blocks (like power supply connections) with parametrized functions
- Standardized the formatting of notes and labels
- Created generic pattern functions for common circuit elements

## Future Improvements

The refactoring process has begun, but there are still opportunities for further improvements:

1. **Complete Multiplexer and ADC Refactoring**: Fully refactor these complex components to use the common utility functions
2. **Parametrize Circuit Values**: Move circuit values to configuration objects/constants
3. **Unit Testing**: Add unit tests for individual drawing functions
4. **Configuration System**: Add a configuration system for global constants and preferences
5. **Component Library**: Create a more extensive library of reusable TMR-specific components

## Usage

The refactored code maintains complete compatibility with the original functionality. Run it with:

```bash
./run_script.sh tmr_schematic_drawer.py
```

All schematics will be generated in the `schematics` directory.
