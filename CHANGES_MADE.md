# Changes Made to TMR Schematic Drawer

## Connection Fixes (March 8, 2023)

### Level Shifter Circuit
1. **Non-inverting Input (Plus Pin) Connection**
   - Added a visible junction dot at `r10_op_conn` to make the connection visible
   - Added a connecting line from the junction to the non-inverting input of the op-amp
   ```python
   # Connect R10 to non-inverting input
   r10_op_conn = (r10_end[0], op_in1[1])
   d += elm.Line().at(r10_end).to(r10_op_conn)
   d += elm.Dot().at(r10_op_conn)  # Added dot at the junction
   d += elm.Line().at(r10_op_conn).to(op_in1)
   ```

2. **Inverting Input (Minus Pin) Connection**
   - Added a missing line connection from R12 to the inverting input
   - Added a junction dot at the inverting input to make the connection visible
   ```python
   # Connect R12 to inverting input
   d += elm.Line().at(r12_end).to(op_in2)
   d += elm.Dot().at(op_in2)  # Added dot at the inverting input
   ```

3. **Output Pin Connection**
   - Added a missing connection from the junction to the start point of R12 (feedback resistor)
   ```python
   r12_start = (op_out_dot[0], op_in2[1])
   d += elm.Line().at(op_out_dot).to(r12_start)  # Added connection to R12 start
   ```

### Active Filter Circuit
1. **Fixed Variable Definition**
   - Added proper definition for `output_point` variable to prevent NameError
   ```python
   op_out_end = (op_out[0]+1, op_out[1])
   d += elm.Line().at(op_out).to(op_out_end)
   d += elm.Dot().at(op_out_end)
   output_point = op_out_end  # Added proper definition
   
   # Fixed references to use output_point instead of output_end
   output_up_end = (output_point[0], output_point[1]+0.5)
   ```

## Structural Improvements

1. **Drawing Function Returns**
   - Updated all drawing functions to return the Drawing object:
     - `draw_instrumentation_amplifier()`
     - `draw_active_filter()`
     - `draw_level_shifter()`
     - `draw_multiplexer()`
     - `draw_adc()`
   
   - Added return statements at the end of each function:
   ```python
   # Return the drawing object
   return d
   ```

2. **Main Function Updates**
   - Modified the main function to properly handle the returned Drawing objects
   - Removed redundant save_drawing calls since the drawing functions now handle saving internally

3. **LTSpice Integration Fixes**
   - Updated the export_to_ltspice function call to match the function signature
   - Fixed model specification handling for component models
   ```python
   # Call the drawing function again to get a fresh drawing object
   drawing = draw_func(unit_size)
   ltspice.export_to_ltspice(name, drawing, ltspice_dir)
   ```

## Level Shifter Implementation Completion

1. **Added Op-Amp Circuit**
   ```python
   # OpAmp
   opamp_pos = (r10_end[0]+2, junction1[1]-1.5)
   opamp = d.add(elm.Opamp(leads=True).at(opamp_pos))
   ```

2. **Added Precision Voltage Reference**
   ```python
   # 3.3V Precision Reference
   vref_pos = (junction1[0]+1, junction1[1]-2)
   vref = d.add(elm.Rect(w=1.5, h=1).at(vref_pos).label('REF3330\n3.3V\nPrecision\nReference', 'center'))
   ```

3. **Added Feedback Network**
   ```python
   # Feedback network
   # R12 from output to inverting input
   op_out_dot = (op_out[0]+0.5, op_out[1])
   d += elm.Line().at(op_out).to(op_out_dot)
   d += elm.Dot().at(op_out_dot)
   ```

4. **Added Output EMI Filter**
   ```python
   # Output EMI filter
   op_out_end = (op_out_dot[0]+1, op_out_dot[1])
   d += elm.Line().at(op_out_dot).to(op_out_end)
   filt_r_end = (op_out_end[0]+1, op_out_end[1])
   filt_r = d.add(elm.Resistor().at(op_out_end).to(filt_r_end).label('33Ω'))
   ```

5. **Added Technical Notes**
   ```python
   # Add design notes
   notes = [
       'Level shifts bipolar ±2.5V signal to 0-3.3V range',
       'Precision voltage reference ensures accuracy',
       'EMI filter prevents noise coupling to ADC',
       'Gain is set by R12/R13 = 10kΩ/4.99kΩ = 2'
   ]
   add_technical_notes(d, (junction1[0]+4, junction1[1]+3), 'NOTES:', notes)
   ```
