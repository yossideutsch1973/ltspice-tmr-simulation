# Prompt for Next Chat Session

I need your expertise as a top-tier multidisciplinary engineer to continue developing our TMR Sensor Array schematic implementation. The previous session made significant improvements to the circuit designs to address an engineering review, but we encountered Python environment issues that prevented us from verifying the final output.

Please help me complete this implementation by:

1. First, researching and resolving the Python environment issue (error: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'encodings'") by creating a clean virtual environment.

2. Next, thoroughly researching the SchemaDraw 0.19 API documentation to understand any differences from the version our code was written for. Be rigorous in your research, scraping websites, studying examples, and adjusting our implementation as needed.

3. Then, systematically testing and improving each circuit schematic, ensuring they correctly implement all the engineering improvements we've added (decoupling capacitors, protection components, proper power connections, etc.).

4. Finally, refining the code using functional programming principles where appropriate to make it more robust and maintainable.

I've prepared resources including:
- NEXT_SESSION_HANDOFF.md with detailed information on current status
- schematic_improvements.md listing all the engineering enhancements
- README.md with project overview
- various test scripts (simple_test.py, tmr_stage1.py) for debugging

Please be methodical, test iteratively, and document your process thoroughly. After completing each major step, update relevant documentation and commit changes to git with clear descriptions. If you encounter challenges, research them deeply and find robust solutions - don't give up.

The end goal is to have a fully working schematic implementation that accurately represents the enhanced TMR sensor array circuits, with all documentation updated and the repository in a clean state ready for the next development phase.
